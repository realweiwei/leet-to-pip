#
# Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent
# elements. You may return the answer in any order.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
# Output: [1,2]
# Example 2:
# Input: nums = [1], k = 1
# Output: [1]
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
# -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
# k is in the range [1, the number of unique elements in the array].
# It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
# 
# 
# 
# Follow up: Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n),
# where n is the array's size.
#
